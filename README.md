# Energy-Efficient-CPU-Scheduling-Algorithm
This repository implements an Energy Efficient CPU Scheduling Algorithm to optimize power consumption while scheduling tasks. It supports Priority Scheduling, Round Robin, FCFS, and SJF algorithms. The project includes a Gantt Chart and calculates Waiting Time and Turnaround Time. Built with Python (Tkinter).
